# book-explorer-app

A small app that:
Lists books (you already know .map()!)
Lets users click a book to view its details (dynamic routing!)
Has Home, About, and Contact pages
Uses React Router for navigation
Demonstrates props, state, and conditional rendering

This is just a practice project to learn the following react concepts.

react-router-dom
<BrowserRouter>, <Routes>, <Route>
<Link> for navigation
useNavigate() for programmatic navigation
useParams() for dynamic routing
